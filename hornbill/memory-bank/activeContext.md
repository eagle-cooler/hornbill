# Active Context - Hornbill App

## Current Work Focus

### Recent Accomplishments
1. **BLoC Architecture**: Implemented complete state management with LibraryBloc, LibraryEvent, and LibraryState
2. **File Manager UI**: Built main FileManagerScreen with directory picker integration
3. **Entry Display**: Created EntryList widget with file type icons and metadata preview
4. **Metadata Panel**: Implemented detailed MetadataPanel for comprehensive file information display
5. **Search Interface**: Added real-time search functionality with text input and filtering
6. **Library Integration**: Successfully integrated eagle_org_layer package for library operations
7. **Material Design**: Applied consistent Material Design 3 theming throughout the app
8. **Cross-Platform Setup**: Configured for Windows, with foundation for other platforms

### Immediate Priorities
1. **Entry Loading Fix**: Debug and fix the entry loading issue (entries showing 0 items)
2. **Error Handling**: Improve error messages and user feedback for failed operations
3. **Performance**: Optimize entry loading and display for large libraries
4. **UI Polish**: Enhance visual design and user experience
5. **Search Enhancement**: Add tag and folder filtering to the search interface

## Next Steps

### Short-term (Current Sprint)
- [ ] Fix entry iteration and loading logic in eagle_org_layer integration
- [ ] Add loading indicators and progress feedback
- [ ] Implement tag and folder filtering in search interface
- [ ] Add file thumbnails and preview capabilities
- [ ] Improve error handling and user feedback

### Medium-term (Next 2-3 weeks)
- [ ] Add grid view mode for entry display
- [ ] Implement entry selection and multi-selection
- [ ] Add context menus and actions
- [ ] Create settings and preferences screen
- [ ] Add keyboard shortcuts and navigation

### Long-term (Next 1-2 months)
- [ ] Implement metadata editing capabilities
- [ ] Add drag and drop support
- [ ] Create library management features
- [ ] Add export and sharing functionality
- [ ] Deploy to other platforms (macOS, Linux, mobile)

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### State Management Architecture
**Decision**: Use BLoC pattern with flutter_bloc package
**Rationale**: 
- Predictable state management with clear event-driven flow
- Excellent testing capabilities
- Good separation of business logic from UI
- Flutter community standard

### UI Framework Choice
**Decision**: Material Design 3 with custom theming
**Rationale**:
- Consistent cross-platform appearance
- Modern design language
- Excellent accessibility support
- Rich component library

### File Display Strategy
**Current Approach**: List view with metadata sidebar
**Considerations**: 
- Add grid view for visual browsing
- Implement virtual scrolling for performance
- Consider thumbnail generation and caching

## Important Patterns and Preferences

### Code Organization
- **BLoC Pattern**: Separate business logic from UI components
- **Widget Composition**: Small, focused widgets with single responsibilities
- **State Immutability**: Use copyWith patterns for state updates
- **Error Boundaries**: Graceful error handling at widget level

### User Experience Principles
- **Immediate Feedback**: Loading states and progress indicators
- **Intuitive Navigation**: Clear visual hierarchy and flow
- **Performance First**: Optimize for large datasets and smooth scrolling
- **Accessibility**: Support for screen readers and keyboard navigation

## Learnings and Project Insights

### Flutter Development
- BLoC pattern works well for complex state management
- File picker integration requires platform-specific considerations
- Material Design provides excellent foundation for cross-platform UI
- Hot reload significantly speeds up UI development

### Integration Challenges
- Eagle library structure more complex than initially anticipated
- Entry loading requires careful path handling and validation
- State synchronization between BLoC and UI requires attention to detail

### Performance Considerations
- Large libraries may require virtual scrolling or pagination
- Metadata loading should be optimized for responsiveness
- Image thumbnails will need efficient caching strategy

## Current Technical State

### Working Components
- ‚úÖ Basic Flutter app structure and navigation
- ‚úÖ BLoC state management architecture
- ‚úÖ Directory picker for library selection
- ‚úÖ Library validation and error display
- ‚úÖ Entry list UI components
- ‚úÖ Metadata display panel
- ‚úÖ Search interface and text filtering

### In Progress
- üîÑ Entry loading and display (debugging)
- üîÑ Error handling and user feedback
- üîÑ Search functionality refinement

### Blockers
- ‚ùå Entry iteration issue preventing display of library contents
- ‚ùå Need better error messages for debugging
- ‚ùå Performance testing with large libraries pending

## Context for Next Session
- App structure and BLoC architecture are solid
- Entry loading integration with eagle_org_layer needs debugging
- UI foundation is in place, ready for feature expansion
- Focus should be on fixing core functionality before adding new features
