# Active Context - Eagle Organization Layer

## Current Work Focus

### Recent Accomplishments
1. **Core Library Loading**: Successfully implemented EagleLibrary class with validation and loading
2. **Model Structure**: Created comprehensive data models for Eagle format compatibility
3. **Entry Management**: Implemented EagleEntry class with proper iteration through .info directories
4. **Base Object Pattern**: Added EagleBaseObject with modify() functionality for changes persistence
5. **Search Functionality**: Implemented getEntry(id) and search(name, tags, folders) methods
6. **Flutter File Manager**: Built complete BLoC-based file manager with:
   - Directory selection dialog
   - Library validation and loading
   - Entry list display with metadata
   - Detailed metadata panel on selection
   - Search interface with real-time filtering
   - Cross-platform Material Design UI
7. **Running Application**: Hornbill app successfully running on Windows

### Immediate Priorities
1. **Real Library Testing**: Test with actual Eagle library data to validate entry structure
2. **Entry Structure Validation**: Confirm .info directory structure and metadata.json format
3. **Error Handling**: Improve error messages for invalid entries and library issues
4. **Search Enhancement**: Add tag and folder filtering to the UI
5. **Performance**: Test with larger libraries and optimize if needed

## Next Steps

### Short-term (Current Sprint)
- [ ] Debug and test library loading with real Eagle library at `C:\Users\zacka\OneDrive\NAMESPACE Me\ASSET\music.library`
- [ ] Implement proper error handling and user feedback
- [ ] Add comprehensive logging for debugging library issues
- [ ] Create unit tests for EagleLibrary.isEagleLibrary() validation

### Medium-term (Next 2-3 weeks)
- [ ] Implement library creation functionality (write new Eagle libraries)
- [ ] Add metadata manipulation capabilities (tags, folders, smart folders)
- [ ] Create Flutter UI components for library browsing
- [ ] Implement search and filtering capabilities

### Long-term (Next 1-2 months)
- [ ] Full Eagle app feature parity
- [ ] Cross-platform deployment testing
- [ ] Performance optimization for large libraries
- [ ] Plugin/extension system design

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Library Path Handling
**Current Issue**: Command-line argument path with spaces requires proper escaping
**Decision**: Use absolute paths in launch.json with proper Windows path format
**Implementation**: `"C:\\Users\\zacka\\OneDrive\\NAMESPACE Me\\ASSET\\music.library"`

### Error Handling Strategy
**Consideration**: How to provide meaningful feedback when library validation fails
**Approach**: 
- Detailed validation with specific missing component reporting
- User-friendly error messages for common issues
- Debug logging for development troubleshooting

### Model Design Philosophy
**Decision**: Mirror Eagle's exact JSON structure for compatibility
**Rationale**: Ensures 100% compatibility with existing Eagle libraries
**Trade-off**: Some non-idiomatic Dart patterns for JSON compatibility

## Important Patterns and Preferences

### Code Organization
- **Models**: Keep data structures in separate files by logical grouping
- **Validation**: Implement validation as static methods on main classes
- **Error Handling**: Use exceptions for invalid states, return types for expected failures
- **Testing**: Use real Eagle library data for integration testing

### Development Workflow
1. **Test-First**: Write tests before implementing new features
2. **Real Data**: Always test with actual Eagle libraries
3. **Cross-Platform**: Validate on Windows primarily, test others secondarily
4. **Documentation**: Document all public APIs and complex logic

## Learnings and Project Insights

### Eagle Library Structure
- Eagle libraries require specific JSON files in exact format
- `images/` folder is critical for validation
- Metadata structure is hierarchical with complex relationships
- Tags and filters are stored separately from folder metadata

### Flutter Package Development
- Use `dart run` for testing console applications in Flutter packages
- VS Code launch.json requires explicit program path for package projects
- Package structure differs from Flutter app structure

### Development Environment
- PowerShell on Windows requires careful path escaping
- VS Code Flutter extension can interfere with pure Dart execution
- Terminal execution is more reliable than launch configuration for initial testing

## Current Technical State

### Working Components
- ‚úÖ Eagle library detection and validation
- ‚úÖ JSON deserialization for all core models
- ‚úÖ Command-line interface for testing
- ‚úÖ Basic error handling and exit codes

### In Progress
- üîÑ Testing with real Eagle library data
- üîÑ Enhanced error reporting and logging
- üîÑ Model validation and edge case handling

### Blockers
- ‚ùå Need to verify real Eagle library structure matches expectations
- ‚ùå Missing comprehensive test coverage
- ‚ùå No user-facing application yet (just testing infrastructure)

## Context for Next Session
- Project is in early foundation phase
- Core library loading logic is implemented but needs validation
- Real-world testing with actual Eagle library is the immediate priority
- Focus should be on ensuring compatibility before building additional features
