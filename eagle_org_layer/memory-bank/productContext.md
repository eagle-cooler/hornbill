# Product Context - Eagle Organization Layer

## Why This Project Exists

### The Problem
Eagle.cool is a popular digital asset management tool, but it has limitations:
- **Proprietary & Closed Source**: Users are locked into a single vendor
- **Platform Limitations**: Limited cross-platform support
- **Feature Constraints**: Missing advanced organization features
- **Data Lock-in**: Difficult to migrate libraries to other tools
- **Cost Barriers**: Premium features require subscription

### The Opportunity
Create an open-source, cross-platform alternative that:
- Maintains full compatibility with Eagle libraries
- Provides enhanced organization capabilities
- Offers superior cross-platform support
- Gives users control over their data
- Enables community-driven development

## How It Should Work

### Core User Experience
1. **Seamless Migration**: Users can point the app at existing Eagle libraries and immediately use them
2. **Enhanced Organization**: Better tagging, smart folders, and search capabilities
3. **Universal Access**: Same library accessible from desktop, mobile, and web
4. **Collaborative Features**: Team sharing and collaboration tools
5. **Extensible Platform**: Plugin system for custom workflows

### Key User Workflows
1. **Library Management**:
   - Import existing Eagle libraries
